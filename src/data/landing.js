    question: "E-Learning Will Replace College By 2050",
    answer:
      "Higher education is expensive, time-consuming, and often outdated. Digital learning provides faster, more affordable access to the same knowledge without the debt. With on-demand education, people can gain skills as they need them instead of paying for years of courses they may never use.",
  },
  {
    icon: "/icons/instant.svg",
    question: "Instant-Access To Interesting Content",
    answer:
      "Traditional education requires applications, waitlists, and scheduled semesters. Here, learning starts the moment you’re ready. Whether you’re picking up a new skill or deepening your expertise, all resources are available immediately—no delays, no barriers.",
  },
  {
    icon: "/icons/learn.svg",
    question: "Decentralized Learning Systems",
    answer:
      "Education is usually tied to institutions that limit access based on cost and location. A decentralized system means learning happens anywhere, anytime, without relying on a single source. This allows knowledge to be freely available rather than locked behind paywalls.",
  },
  {
    icon: "/icons/paint-brush.svg",
    question: "Highest Quality & Standards Assured",
    answer:
      "Many online learning platforms lack credibility or don’t offer proof of achievement. Here, credentials are verified and stored securely, making it easy to prove your skills without needing approval from a third party.",
  },
  {
    icon: "/icons/puzzle.svg",
    question: "Skill-to-Income Pathways",
    answer:
      "Most jobs require proof of experience, but getting that experience often requires already having a job. By connecting learning with real-world applications, this platform helps people turn new skills into financial opportunities without unpaid internships or additional schooling.",
